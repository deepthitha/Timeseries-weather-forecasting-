#Temperature prediction using time series

The data set is in a csv format , which contains 2186 rows and 5 columns .
It contains the temperature of a city in a day at different times from the year 2014 to 2019.

#About the project

In this project we are using ARIMA model for forecasting the temperature.
ARIMA- stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average

 This is helpful in making predictions of events that happen over a period of time.
It uses past data for forecasting and its a base for SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

#How is ARIMA used in forecasting?
1. Visualize the time series data
2. Identify if the data is staionary
3. Plot the correlation and Auto correlation charts
4. Construct the ARIMA model or SARIMA based on the data.

#Steps involved in forecasting the temperature dataset

1. Importing libraries- Pmdarima (Used as a statistical and ml libraries)
2.  Loading the file
3. Visualizing the data set (avg temp
4. Examine for staionarity
5. Selecting predictors and order for ARIMA model
6. Splitting the data set into train and test
7. Training using ARIMA model 
8. Predicting the results on test data 
9. Checking with a random future dates
10. Plotting the graph
